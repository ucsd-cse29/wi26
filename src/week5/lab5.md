# Lab 5 Reference Document


Part 1: `.vimrc` addendum and ssh `config`
--------------------------------

In the file `~/.vimrc` on ieng6, add:

```
set cindent
```

On Your computer (not ieng6) create the file `~/.ssh/config`:

```
Host <shortcut> <possibly more shortcuts>
    HostName <the host name of the ssh server>
    User <your username on the ssh server>

```

Part 2: GDB Debugging
--------------------------------

### New GDB commands
#### `start [ARGUMENTS]`

Starts the program with the specified arguments and pauses at the first line of `main`.

#### `break LINE_NUMBER`

Sets a **breakpoint** at the specified line number. (**Breakpoint**: a line in the program at which GDB will stop at before the line executes.)

#### `next`

Executes to the next line of code.

#### `step`

If the next line contains a function call, steps into the first line of the function. Otherwise, behaves the same way as `next`.

#### `continue`

Continues running the program until the next breakpoint.

The line that is shown above the `(gdb)` prompt *has not run yet*. It is the line that will run if you type `next`.

Part 3: Hacking
---------------------

## 3.1. Background

Imagine that you're a less ethical student than I'm sure you actually are. You
overhear from some other students in lab that there's a binary available on the
pi-cluster that can show you your grades on assignments before we formally
release them. You hear quieter whispers that someone found a way to use it to
_change_ their grade. Given our less-than-ethical assumption about your state
of mind, you might be tempted to exploit this for yourself.  

## 3.2. The Plot Thickens

You see some code open on the professor's laptop during office hours.  You do
your best to commit it to memory and write it down (remember, you're acting
quite unethically in this story), because it strikes you that the code was
something regarding assignment scores.  
![gradebook source code](../images/gradebook_src.png)

Using this information, you decide to give yourself and A with a score 
to match while maintaining a real due date.  
**HINT**
When important values are adjacent on the stack, overflowing an array with
values that you control can let you assign into other stack-allocated values.


GDB commands that may be useful for this activity:

-   `(gdb) info locals`

-   `(gdb) info args`

-   `(gdb) print VALUE (or p VALUE)` You can print any variable or expression, e.g.

-   `print x`, `p arr[5]`, `p ((x & 0b1111) << 3)`

-   You can also specify a format to print in

-   `print/t` (binary), `print/x` (hex), `print/d` (decimal)

-   `(gdb) x ADDRESS` This prints out memory at an address, e.g. strings / arrays / pointers

-   `(gdb) x/16cb str1` This prints the first 16 bytes of `str1` as characters

-   `(gdb) x/20xb str2` This prints 20 bytes of `str2` in hex

-   `(gdb) x/4dw  arr` This prints 4 "words" (i.e. `int32s`) of `arr`, as decimal numbers

-   You can use the following [reference card](https://darkdust.net/files/GDB%20Cheat%20Sheet.pdf) for reference on gdb commands, and format commands for x and print.

Work Check-off

Push a copy-paste or screenshot of your `gdb` session from part 2 when investigating `index_of_E` to the github classroom assignment for this lab.
