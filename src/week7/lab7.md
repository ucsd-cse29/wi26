# Lab 8 Reference Document


Part 1: git good
--------------------------------

### Partner Activity
Get into groups of 2, and decide who will be **Partner 1** and **Partner 2**.

#### Partner 1 ONLY:
1. Create a new team on the Github Classroom assignment for you and your partner (DO NOT accept until we do this together in class): <https://classroom.github.com/a/IcKc8biR> 

#### Partner 2 ONLY:
2. Join the team that Partner 1 created.

#### Both:

3. Clone the repo to ieng6
4. Edit `hello.c` to fill in your own name in the print statement


#### Partner 1 ONLY:

5. Commit and push this change


#### Partner 2 AFTER PARTNER 1 HAS PUSHED:

6. Commit and then attempt to push this change

Work together on Partner 2's computer. Resolve the merge conflict so that the program prints `Hello [PARTNER 1 NAME] and [PARTNER 2 NAME]!`. Commit and push when done.
(Hint: `git pull` and `git config pull.rebase false` may be useful)


Once finished:

Repeat starting from step 4 with `goodbye.c` and switch roles (i.e. Partner 2 commits and pushes first, then Partner 1 tries to push. Resolve conflict on Partner 1's computer)



Part 2: More Terminal Commands
--------------------------------

#### `mv [FILE] [PATH]`

Move the file `[FILE]` to the location specified by `[PATH]`.

#### `cp [FILE] [PATH]`

Copy the file `[FILE]` to the location specified by `[PATH]`.

#### `scp [FILE] [PATH]`

Copy the file `[FILE]` to the location specified by `[PATH]`. `[FILE]` and `[PATH]` can both be located on a server. So for example, if you had `Screenshot.png` in your working directory, you could `scp` it to the home directory on `ieng6` by (also filling in USERNAME with your actual username):
```
scp Screenshot.png USERNAME@ieng6.ucsd.edu:~/
```
And then you can move the screenshot to your lab8-starter repo using `mv`. 

Here's the diagram of what that looks like to `scp` from your laptop/desktop to the repo on `ieng6`, and then push to `GitHub`:
![scp.png](./scp.png)




Work Check-off
--------------

Run `git log`, which shows the commit history of the repo. Take a screenshot to show that both partners made commits, and push that screenshot to the repo.  (Hint: `scp`) Each partner should push their own screenshot to receive credit for the checkoff.
