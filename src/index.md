[Joe Gibbs Politz](https://jpolitz.github.io) (Instructor)

CSE 29 introduces you to the broad field of systems programming, including 1)
the basics of how programs execute on a computer, 2) programming in C with
direct access to memory and system calls, 3) software tools to manage and
interact with code and programs. All very cool stuff that makes every programmer
better!
